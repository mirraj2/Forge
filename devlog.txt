save tilesets and tileset metadata to the filesystem automatically.
  for now, we'll just do it on exit

have it load that data on startup

link objects to the action bar

add objects to different layers of the map

add view options for only showing certain layers and showing the grid, etc

key insights
  - Each object is on its own layer and z-ordering can be changed with +/- or mousewheel
  - when you draw an autotile, it becomes a new layer UNLESS your mouse drag started on an autotile
    in which case it will append onto that existing autotile's layer

add objects to the map, select them, move them, change z-order
add autotiling
add portals
add tagging

think about adding 'extensions' to allow for game-specific map editing
