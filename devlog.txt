save tilesets and tileset metadata to the filesystem automatically.
  for now, we'll just do it on exit

have it load that data on startup

link objects to the action bar

add objects to different layers of the map

add view options for only showing certain layers and showing the grid, etc

key insights
  - Each object is on its own layer and z-ordering can be changed with +/- or mousewheel
  - when you draw an autotile, it becomes a new layer UNLESS your mouse drag started on an autotile
    in which case it will append onto that existing autotile's layer

add objects to the map, select them, move them, change z-order
add autotiling
add portals
add tagging

think about adding 'extensions' to allow for game-specific map editing

2/11/15

add auto-persistence of the objects
make z-ordering smart -- move the object past the first object which intersects with the selected one
try to actually make a map -- see what's missing
  -undo
add portals
add tagging

think about how NPCs should be added, or if that should just be done with tagging

also, think about a way to get amazing art like the two pieces on your desktop into the game CINEMATIC ART!

2/13/15

try to make a map
  -autotiling of other things besides flat terrain
    -cliff sides
    
2/16/15

make moving an object be something that is undo-able
add tagging of tiles
make it so you can specify collisions
add map linking
make it so you can create a new map and go back to an old map

2/17/15

tile collisions
ability to create a new map / load an old one
export to various formats

2/20/15

Make youtube video(s) showing it off. Give it to other people to use and try to get people to make stuff!
